# zbelard

Zbelard is a full-stack JS framework... batteries-included and opinionated... as close to standards as possible... as less abstractions as possible... and most importantly, cool as fuck!

## Installing the deps

```bash
deno install --allow-scripts
```

<!-- TODO add docs about db migrations -->
